# Dreams of Women

This initiative is a wing of the [DreamSpace Academy](https://www.dreamspace.academy) aims to support young girls and women in science, technology, engineering, mathematics and arts (STEAM). DoW firmly believes in a world where women are embraced in STEAM fields and are able to equally contribute to the development of a community and a country through those sectors.

## Our Vision

To create a world where the dreams of women in STEAM are nurtured and to build a space where women have been equally embraced in all sectors, breaking any stigma against them in the Global South.

## Our Mission

To build the STEAM dreams of girls and women through mentoring, challenged-based learning, grassroots innovation, and impact venture building.

## Get Involved

We welcome support, collaboration, and participation from all who share our vision. Whether you are a STEAM professional interested in mentoring, a volunteer willing to contribute your skills, or a donor keen on supporting our cause, there is a place for you at DoW.
